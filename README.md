To start the frontend test:

To create the mockServiceWorker.js file:
 <b> npm run msw-init</b>

## WalkThrough

<p>Step 1</p>
<p>Both Upload page and List page are currently empty</p>

<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Click on the List button at the Navbar to see the list retrieved from the backend</p>

<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Due to time constraint, there is no user friendly way to delete the uploaded file from the backend, hence should be deleted manually. The application can still work without deleting the file as it will overwrite the data.csv file but deletion is required in order to demonstrate the whole process.</p>
